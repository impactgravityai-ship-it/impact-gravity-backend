## 🔔 Alert Banner

### "The December 2025 Hiring Reality"
With pulsing red border and gradient animation:

"AI is now screening 90% of resumes. If your resume looks like it was generated by ChatGPT or worse, actually was, it's getting auto-rejected. Recruiters see 100 AI-spam resumes daily. Yours needs to be different. Not copy-paste. Not generic. Strategically crafted to beat both ATS algorithms AND human skepticism."
